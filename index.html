            <h2>Starting Out</h2>
            <p>
              From an early age, sport was a constant in my life. I cannot remember a time when I
              was not competing in some form, always driven by a natural enjoyment of movement and
              competition.
            </p>
            <p>
              I met my first coach, <strong>Phil Budd</strong>, who identified my strengths early
              and helped establish a strong technical and physical foundation. In January 2019,
              after just one month of structured training, I placed third at the County
              Championships as a bottom-year athlete.
            </p>
            <p>
              At an age where physical maturity often dictates success, this performance challenged
              expectations and marked a turning point.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the age of ten, I moved into a specialised middle-distance training group under my
              second coach, <strong>Alan Crook</strong>.
            </p>

        <h2>The Competition</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout my running career, I have encountered numerous challenges through formidable
          teammates and rivals. My first significant rival was Eddie Clegg, whose constant
          presence pushed my early development.
        </p>
        <p>
          He possessed an intense and highly competitive running style that tested my physical and
          mental limits. Adapting to his unorthodox approach taught me how to navigate
          high-pressure scenarios and ultimately made me a more resilient athlete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another significant influence on my career is Max Harrison, a runner for Hercules
          Wimbledon. We first met at Young Athlete Camp, where we developed a close friendship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite our contrasting running styles, we constantly challenge one another during
          training. Max has instilled in me a deep sense of drive and a professional standard of
          discipline; because of his influence, my commitment is unwavering, and skipping sessions
          is no longer a consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I have a strong competitive relationship with Luca Di Giovanni. Although he is a
          year older and trains in a different group within our club, we maintain a healthy
          rivalry.
        </p>

      <section id="training">
        <h2>Training &amp; Development</h2>
        <p>
          My training is structured around long-term athletic development rather than short-term
          success. Instead of chasing volume for its own sake, I keep my weekly load controlled at
          around 35 km.
        </p>
        <p>
          A typical week includes 2 quality sessions, 3 easy runs, 1 cross-training session, and 2
          gym sessions. This helps recovery, supports consistency, and improves power output through
          better strength and mechanics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through summer, the emphasis shifts toward speed work and shorter repetitions to sharpen
          race-specific performance.
