    <h2>Starting Out</h2>

    <p>
      From an early age, sport was a constant in my life. I cannot remember a time when I was not competing in some form, always driven by a natural enjoyment of movement and competition.
    </p>

    <p>
      I met my first coach, <u>Phil Budd</u>, who identified my strengths early and helped establish a strong technical and physical foundation. In January 2019, after just one month of structured training, I placed third at the County Championships as a bottom-year athlete.
    </p>

    <p>
      At an age where physical maturity often dictates success, this performance challenged expectations and marked a turning point.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the age of ten, I moved into a specialised middle-distance training group under my second coach, <u>Alan Crook</u>.

  <h2>The Competition</h2>
 <p>
  Throughout my running career, I have encountered numerous challenges through 
  formidable teammates and rivals. My first significant rival was Eddie Clegg, 
  whose constant presence pushed my early development. He possessed an 
  intense and highly competitive running style that tested my physical 
  and mental limits. Adapting to his unorthodox approach taught me how to 
  navigate high-pressure scenarios and ultimately made me a more resilient athlete.
</p>

<p>
  Another significant influence on my career is Max Harrison, a runner for 
  Hercules Wimbledon. We first met at the 
  <a href="https://www.youngathletecamp.co.uk/" id="YAC">Young Athlete Camp</a>, 
  where we developed a close friendship. Despite our contrasting running 
  styles, we constantly challenge one another during training. Max has 
  instilled in me a deep sense of drive and a professional standard of 
  discipline; because of his influence, my commitment is unwavering, and 
  skipping sessions is no longer a consideration.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, I have a strong competitive relationship with Luca Di Giovanni. 
  Although he is a year older and trains in a different group within our club, 
  we maintain a healthy rivalry. This dynamic encourages us to consistently 
  better ourselves while remaining dedicated to the club's collective success. 
  I look forward to our continued competition in the years to come.
